I have developed new text representation structures to facilitate these tasks and new methods to calculate the semantic similarity between texts. I have proposed a new measure of similarity, called soft cosine similarity, which considers the semantic information of characteristics such as words, n-grams, POS tags, etc. I have seven years of experience working as Oracle DBA and software developer in several companies in the public and private sector in Paraguay. I also have more than three years of teaching experience at the National University of Asunción and at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/helena-montserrat-gomez-adorno/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/helena-montserrat-gomez-adorno/","section":"authors","summary":"My research areas are natural language processing, computational linguistics and information retrieval; specifically applications, search for answers, semantic similarity, attribution of authorship and author profiling.
