title: "CONACYT Project 298036: Feria de Talleres Mexicanas del Futuro: Trazando conciencias, pensando en TI Edición IIMAS UNAM."
summary: "The project aims at promoting the scientific-technological vocation among female students of UNAM's highschool. For this, we invite the girls to study a science and technology career through conferences and workshops in a fun and interesting environment to show them that thinking that women and technology do not get along is an unfounded prejudice. We held a workshop fair at UNAM campus. Worshops and talks were given by professional women from the world of academy and industry, focused on the student population of the UNAM. "
