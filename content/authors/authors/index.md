I am researcher at [Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas](https://www.iimas.unam.mx), [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México](http://unam.mx/). I finished my Ph. D. in Computer Science at the Centro de Investigación en Computación, IPN. My research interests are in the field of natural language processing and text mining. I have worked on semantic similarity, authorship attribution, author profiling, and several text classification problems. During my Ph.D. I introduced text representation structures based on graphs to facilitate NLP tasks and a new method to calculate the semantic similarity between texts, called soft cosine similarity, which considers the semantic information of characteristics such as words, n-grams, POS tags, etc.
