My research areas are natural language processing, computational linguistics and information retrieval; specifically applications, search for answers, semantic similarity, attribution of authorship and author profiling. I have developed new text representation structures to facilitate these tasks and new methods to calculate the semantic similarity between texts. I have proposed a new measure of similarity, called soft cosine similarity, which considers the semantic information of characteristics such as words, n-grams, POS tags, etc.
I have seven years of experience working as Oracle DBA and software developer in several companies in the public and private sector in Paraguay. I also have more than three years of teaching experience at the National University of Asunción and at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
